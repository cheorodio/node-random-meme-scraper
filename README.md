# Node.js Random Meme Generator

An upLeveled Node.js project that challenges me to create a cli (Command Line Interface) application that scrapes the current version of this [Meme website](memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app) and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project. The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.

## Set up
Enter `node index.js` in the console to run the program
